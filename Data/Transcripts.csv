negative,yeah I guess so my guess is it's either for doing some sort of speech recognition systems for computers or for building a there's a field of computational linguistics with a look at the properties of languages with the probabilities of our various kinds of words occurring together and such and all that yeah that's what it's for and I need a photo she's coming along and how are your grandkids

negative,walking around and just a nice nice little boy a little bit small and stuff and they could do no because use this and use that but all-in-all sure she's fine
negative, are you doing we're fine that's is just beginning to get more fussy because she can walk now and then she see that that's very early for walking and sisters that's his cousin also booked at 9 month so she's a walking for about 5 weeks now she can climb stairs she climbs on chairs and you know we have to tell her know a lot more now and she remembers things so we can't distract her as easily anymore so she's had to do a little preto temper tantrums and things like if she was to the unrolling all the toilet paper and she just thought it was funny when I didn't she just put her hands on her hips and started crying and she had this power and we've had a few of those this week
negative, started but then she remembers she doesn't remember words now it surprises me like the other day I said do you want to go upstairs and change it and give clean diaper or something like that and she said what you was doing whenever to the stairs and I don't know what piece of that she understood diaper or stairs or what but some things are getting through and she had said her first word which was kitty kitty cat which is our cat I don't know but she knows that it's a general word it serve a proper noun for her sudden after months of saying pet the kitty gently and showing her how she's putting her gently instead of just grabbing her and try and put her in her mouth so
negative, when is she going to be here August 24th of August
negative, she's a parative and determined but yeah he is very headstrong her daycare people say whenever there's a conflict between the two kids at me and took his a daycare that's always wins in even though she's much smaller than these other kids she's just very focused and very determined she doesn't cry she doesn't look at another kid she just goes for the toy that they're holding you know in Chucky at it until she gets it and then and not nice part of this that I'm sure we'll get better over age I hope is to play with the toy as long as the other kids interested if anyone there no longer interested she throws it away
negative, we can get to analytical about I've seen probably better this way because you can train her to not be nasty more easily you can train a shy kid to stand up for herself so I think she'll be okay how is your teaching going well I'm not doing it right now I'm off for summer which is real
negative, I am treated much more as a job instead of my life now this is no longer the central thing but my course was on a course in normal language acquisition being taught to students of communicative who were majoring in communicative disorders so their students were going to go on and practice and so they're not very theoretically oriented therapy oriented and they're not as good as my students at San Diego but they can learn you know it was a writing-intensive course and all of these kids they were undergrads but they have to go to graduate school practice you can't you can't practice without a master's so they knew they had to go to graduate school so they really did work very hard they knew they had to get it be in at midterms almost all of them had season 2 days until they pulled it up they work very very hard and that was awarding
negative," I'll have to teach two courses instead of one in the fall now I'm not looking forward to that but it's okay my research has slowed down tremendously and that's bothering me a little more time trying to write over the summer but I've got about five papers to write I'll probably get two and a half done and I would love to get a grant out but I don't know when that will be is not going to be the summer having problems keeping its enrollments up and so we've been a little worried that at one point it look like they might lay off some untenured people and in the end they didn't do that and doing stupid things like they want to start a football team which is a considerable Financial investment at the same time they were talking about laying off faculty"
negative, and they think by having a football team will generate more interest among the undergraduate some more enrollment and I think that is a school with a population of 700 that's not the best way to spend your money did never going to be good football team you know it's not an intellectual this is so American it hurts anywhere I've been before I even know if the rules of this call let me put on another caller but I figured at the 15-minute point I put Sam on and he can tell you more about that how are you guys how is Christmas
negative, they called felt medicine says missing is surveying and so she's going to wait for 2 weeks to come back tonight so looking forward to that
negative, yeah well Claudia has been here we've been we've been doing okay and I'm actually waiting for Buddy to show up because we're we're supposed to go into town and meet some people in town I got a student here who is looking to a checking out rooms and stuff she's coming in the fall but she was in a place called tagua and I'll test has this been so so is any in semester is still going across it ends on the 22nd of July

negative, when was it made them right after my father died right after we talked

negative, just had bad luck I guess it's how you saying
negative, anything anybody could do so and then an atom and out of Chris's at met me up in the end passed away from Archer yeah I think there was some concern about her when I talk to you in September or October well I actually got to see you I guess a day before she died I mean she didn't know if she didn't know that
negative, so it was a blessing I guess but anyway weird stuff about you
negative, no I have to go next week to see check out you know to see again I exactly convinced it it's okay you know it's been pretty good about 80% for a while and then I am not exactly sure what it is and I'll know in a couple days
negative, visioner oh yeah yeah right eyes that's a great day we got back about 80% and then they operate on it once or twice and then it would seem seems seems to be to be doing pretty well in this moment I'm a little more so who knows but I know it'll never be more than about 70 or 80%
negative, so just want to see

negative, let you know I went from Chicago to UCSD to here and it's just such an intellectual left left down and she went from Penn to to Columbia to URI the students are just don't care and they're not very good and all the sudden she's getting conference papers rejected and she thinks it's the affiliation because she doesn't think it was quality of her work is changed now I haven't submitted a conference paper with the misery you know affiliation yet because the last one I submitted was in the fall and I still had my San Diego affiliation in fact I'm still officially on leave if anything came up in the next year we can also go back for Sam but I think it's very very very very unlikely but I did anyway it was nice to hear from her because she said after 2 years there now she have come to terms with this and she's accepted
negative, there's a lot of good things in Rhode Island and their life is a lot less complicated and she's more time to be a parent and she's just not going to have the same kind of career that she thought about Ron is working as a Financial Consultant for Merrill Lynch and yeah he had been doing work for some environmental firm as a consultant and it didn't work out he he was changing projects every couple of weeks and he said he couldn't keep on top of it he couldn't learn the whole new area that fast each time and he says he went and had some tough and he was diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder which you know given how how how far he's gotten you know it goes degree at Tufts and all I found that surprising that for the first time as an adult they're diagnosing us
negative, I wonder about it but anyway he seems to be happy with that and then you tell Leo and Julie at Christmas time and they're doing great and older home that near Julie's of course carving up and making beautiful now she had a job with an Architectural Group when she first got out to New York and that didn't work out she said they had her doing things that she really wasn't qualified to do and if she really didn't feel competent doing and they mutually agreed that she should leave and said she was looking for another job and I'm sure she'll sign one she's so talented she may have found Adrian
negative, kid who is Ferrari and just a really lovely little boy he's so big picture of theirs and he has Ron's Expressions he really looks like Ron if you look really big to in this picture is 3 and 1/2 but Leon Julie just seemed so happy with the decisions they've made and

negative, it's interesting that the first year you sit is your happy have a job stuff goes well then the second year you figure out what's wrong and you figure it's not that hard to fix it
negative, and I suspect in another year or so I'll be used to the fact that he picks his butt
negative, probably wonder sometimes whether it's all worth it especially when you drink committees where are you you're supposed to be doing something but then the ministration goes and does something else entirely and say you've wasted your time and tire only now it's it's a little frustrating but it's
negative, it's not any worse here than anywhere else it's just a shock.
negative, I have a student who
negative, actually I haven't had in a class but he's going to go tubing in in
negative, there's 96-97 on a rotary scholarship
negative, yes the guy you are already that you got this yeah well he hasn't got the official letter but he's he's been selected from the Missouri area so he should do it going it's great because he didn't have enough money to go he was thinking he really wanted to go but he was just giving up until after I finished school and then go for trip and I talked him into looking into this cuz I knew it I knew you could transcript
negative, now to get his competition in this area wouldn't be that tough so I don't work actually accomplish something
negative, crying like a how to get to the graduate school or whatever you do ear on the CNN by day by day is like like building like Stephen Carpenter and Alex are concentrated they are good students and high-impact really aware of it when I end up doing
negative, see us some vice-president some stuff so I showed up here at the other day and get a little talk and children. I was quite a nice guy I was teaching I think engineering and he's moved into this area in this area now he's got a moving up the the yard just one day you'll probably be a college President somewhere I mean I think that's what's on his mind and and it's very very nice person and really a lot a lot going for
negative, different priorities different things that were important for him and I think that's the power to certain extent and maybe
negative, different kinds of problems and maybe more of the people who were teaching or running a program or nobody gets tied down as with a small little corner and thinks that corner is kind of the beginning of the end World Without End laundry happy doing what I'm doing
negative,so okay so when you tell me your deep dark secrets only had a good how are you I am good at your presents it will be coming okay thank you thank you for calling things were so crazy these last weeks and then I finally got it together to call you and then the pin number had run out of time so I had to wait another week and then last week didn't work until have to wait another week and it's so it goes our time schedules are really pretty terrible and what happens with me then which is really stupid is that when I think about calling it's a long day of course and if you don't get the right day. I didn't forget it and get it cuz our schedules are absolutely sure on Thursday really nice to call yeah oh well anyway and anyways because otherwise
negative,crazy crazy by Jesse told me you were so busy you couldn't go see Mom yeah she's having a wonderful place didn't even acknowledge that they probably hit or later you know you didn't remember it but it seems as if you heard that the idea of getting somebody else to pay with a good idea yeah it's a great idea
negative,"and then it's nice because you can do that much more often you it's wonderful for her so that we can really jazzed anyway he's doing pretty well he's so you know he had a very mild stroke I think if you have a stroke at all he had the best kind you can have and evidently it he has an irregular heartbeat which is what they think caused it the kind that is it the regular all the time evidently it causes it's the possibility of causing a clot is very high and so they I don't quite understand if they're going to do this or not but sometimes they administer a small shock to try and get it through his back on track. Get back to normal beat but otherwise he just tried with drugs or something well know what they do is they"
negative,give him drugs for an anticoagulant so that whatever clot was in there and cause that hopefully gets dissolved but then they you know they have to monitor that very closely because for example a week and a half ago they said okay you can't stays until we see you again and other words you'll bleed to death if you are at the very dangerous what's actually what's more dangerous is that some sort of internal bleeding begins and you don't know about it until you're dead so but they they cut him down to 1 check up a week instead of two which is very promising and you know how it goes those little things I'm sure you would call a very meaningful meeting yesterday and that was the something to do with the hospital until we went we had. We had lunch at the hospital really weird going into the hospital I must have been very weird
negative,have you been to that hospital since I've been looking at it for a while already so it was okay I was looking I was there for two days for meeting the day before I had already looked up because I know that the walkway between the two parts of the buildings where I wouldn't walk around with things like that and we had coffee and the people they're going over there until we joked about things in there for about project yeah there's a there's a group of people who do work and computer stuff in languages here at the hospital
negative,so anyway you been horribly busy but now it's now it's over with now it's okay how long do you get to feel normal again anyway for them to like going through your email electronic new and clean out these last two hundred messages that you had ignored didn't have time to look at them that sounds like a nightmare I come home to three messages on my answering machine and they're practically shut the thing off for exactly with lightning would strike into the store or something
negative,you have nice and we can see yeah yeah I had a wonderful time with Jesse that was really great except she probably told you don't go to Santa Barbara during Fiesta
negative, not the time to go to Santa Barbara 20 million people there I mean not no kidding but it was really fun anyway so we get rid of burned-out going downtown there's a Fourth of July there's not that many people not compared you're not overwhelmed by people nothing like Fiesta I mean it was nothing and that's probably you know we don't have much to compare while you have more cuz you been there more but that's probably more than is usually there and Siesta was just that means I think half of Los Angeles went to Santa Barbara Fiesta
negative, Sodom it was fun anyway well it was Ian killer I was with Jesse if I just get in the car and the traffic jam and talk to her I don't really care but it wasn't what is Fiesta anyway I don't know it's a general term I mean they have that New Mexico to it's just it's a Hispanic celebration I don't know what it is if it even if you know it acknowledges some particular date or anything I think it's just a yearly you know Festival like like Carnival or something just the time everybody gets dressed up and you know how many does incredibly cute little kids start wearing purple is truly outfit makeup and they look so proud of themselves and their room really really cute but it's just you know lots of Kool-Aid lots and lots of place Hunnam played seem to be the two main thing to do and then you know stands where you can get all kinds of you know tacos in this kind of thing and
negative, sorry it's been singing and stuff like that so I don't really know what it is beyond that but it was really fun anyways but that's no even know that was in the special historical not that I know of no I mean in New Mexico saying they just have something called Fiesta and it just everybody has a big party and I don't know if there's anything connected to it or not but anyway that was lots of fun and then we have to meet you at your place
negative, because I wanted to congratulate you on the cowboy boots I heard he had seen those before that and remembered everything to me and I kept refusing to try them on cuz I thought
negative, you know why should I try them on their kind of dollars I'm not going to buy them but anyway she remember it so that was really really sweet and anyway I have some stuff it was a fun visit unfortunately that all happened with Josh's dad right when we were going to go somewhere but we had fun time anyway and some friends of mine were looking around you know where Jesse to Jesse tell you where they went and stayed
negative, well I don't remember that she said the name or anything just it was somewhere yeah I took place it's very special to them that they told us about we went and visited it before we even came here and it's just us bills beautiful Canyon that's looks like paradise the minute you walk into it that little cabins for rent there and when Josh my first visited the hallways and moved here
negative, we both just went out let's just say one of those cabins forget about having a cat one person a day comes and has a cup of coffee anyways it's really really pretty and evidently Michael had
negative, Ashley guess he went with him years and years ago when he was at UCLA there's a research station up in this Canyon and and we have
negative, and different yeah right anyway so that's how that spot came into the picture and they finally went there and stay there and had a wonderful time and some friends of mine who lives here were looking at property for sale all over the place and that was one of the places they were looking in that stick Euler area and so I got them to give me the real estate now so where it wasn't sent it to Jesse Michael and I put little arrow that said you are here hoping to egg them on so I figure I mean it's none of my business and you know it's hard to say what what people you know I asked I asked Jesse Point Blank you know can you
negative, are you in a position to buy something right now it's you know the land here relatively speaking it's really cheap I mean like $500 an acre and she said yeah so I thought you know whatever happens maybe they should just buy some land and you know if whatever they can come and camp on it you know when they come to visit cuz they don't like that and breakfasts and you know sometimes it's good when you have the money to get the things you want because you're waiting on you I mean I'm just imagining you know what their position is cuz it's I'm sure it's very hard when you're doing something and you can't get out of it you know to do a Nice N Easy at least to have you have some vacation time or something you know whatever whatever happens in the future if you buy some land you it's yours I mean in the taxes or nothing
negative, yeah but now's the time because you're States really going up around here now some Southeastern Arizona has gotten a lot of attention and I think there's lots of sleep and Refugee type stuff happening where people are
negative, unhappy more and more with the city and they don't know what to do or how to leave for how to make a living but love people just come here and go fuck it I'll figure something out I know so it's kind of a strange thing to be happening very sure does anti what we were all brought up to to do is the American dream where you get your career and your little house and everything in it anyway so I've been trying to comfort them so I told him that we would go and look at this property if they wanted anyway yeah but they also fix the Christmas vacation there so yeah I heard about that
negative, yeah maybe they really you know obviously they're attracted to that area can't Michael even more so it's kind of isolated but anyway I think those guys you know they just as soon go camp out somewhere and stay in the bed and breakfast and have to have breakfast with 15 people they never met before they usually come running over here instead even though the breakfast is paid for him we sit on the patio and have breakfast instead I actually a sound a little apartment I mean just to be for you to if you were interested in it or house is hard to put up money we can't one person's okay with two it gets pretty hard but the weight we just changed everything around and it's really not much privacy at all for you know people visiting but we just found some acquaintances of ours that come to the cafe they have
negative, very small apartment that they rent to people visiting which you know has little tiny kitchen and it's just very nice and private and I like you just have your own place right so it's not a hotel or it's not a place like somebody's places in Des Pere you know the bathroom is down the hall this kind of thing. So much fun inexpensive besides and other than that they're these nice bed-and-breakfast anyway that's a nice option it's thirty bucks tonight because I have an extra apartments or they do they have like a little and it's called an in-law apartment here like a small apartment you know it's totally separate entrance and all that and it has little kitchen and everything so I think that's being nice things for pizza that's all you have to do it yourself and record what does blast a hole in the Rock underneath our house
negative, the hope that be nice
negative, anyway anyway how's it how's business going it's going okay this month has been kind of slow but for the most part is we're doing pretty good it's you know it's a we live in such a small town that you have to try to scare your expectations down a little bit from the food you know when you live in a town that's only got sixty five hundred people in it are you know customer pool is and very tiny and we've been email breaking even for a long time we would like to make a little bit more so that we can
negative, not work quite so hard but most of the time we feel really pretty lucky that we are have done as well as we have given given how small the town is north of the question is complete to rationalize and in a way that to you making enough money in that still fun for you yeah that's what's the best way to rationalize that's hard to say cuz sometimes you getting another mood like a stream of things happen like Josh's dad and he had to go away and that was kind of expensive for us to replace him and then clicks you know he's a satin everybody's upset I was upset that gets exhausting and then you know the next the first days off we had together I went I got stung by scorpion which is no big deal it's just what I heard it was horrible pain for it it was ridiculous 10 minutes on timer for 12 hours which is really
negative," at the real I mean there goes your whole day you know and but you don't know they don't actually that's not that I know of anyway that's all they tell you is to just do that you know I did it for so I actually gave myself a little frostbite I mean I made a little burn on my leg I mean it's kind of numb the pain for how long can you keep track of 10 minutes on and turn that off. God it was really ridiculous and it's you know nuts once you find out you're not allergic to them and you're not going to have convulsions and die you know it's no big deal except that it hurts like stance holy hell I mean it's like it's like a burn pain where it gets to this level where you think you're going to scream if you don't put ice pack on you know"
negative, anyway so that was one our first day off and then the plumbing backed up twice in the last three to two and a half weeks in the cafe when bread is backed up at 10 in the morning on Saturday night lights on
negative, so we had to close for the rest of the day and if I'm leading up to as if it's things like that happens you know a few weeks in a row your mood kind of tends to go to Hell lyrics level is somewhere around 08 going this sucks you know and I'm sick of being poor and I'm sick of these and then it goes away and it's not so bad you know we're really you know we're really pretty lucky in a lot of ways so it's that's all I'm going to say is your moods artist it's hard to try to judge these things sometimes you to have a good week this week was just fine
negative," and you know it's very quiet downtown so we don't take it personally that were that the business is a little quiet and it's it's not that quiet either so y'all could get it coming and yeah we do you know pretty regular Bunch it's not the kind of town also where people's income has small enough that the only people that really can't afford to go out to lunch and then people will go out to breakfast you know coffee and stuff like that but lunch is more of a luxury so you you haven't even smaller pool of people who work for the county for example and have you know really steady jobs that we have a really nice Bunch especially from the courthouse there's a group of the whole public defender's office and they really fun bunch and they always have these wild arguments which are really fun and interesting to listen to"
negative, hey get to it like a local politics and they're really smart you know for the most part liberal Bunch who are very open about lots of other things that they think and I guess public defender's offices are are generally usually pretty liberal do-gooder type people who want to you know they don't get paid very much and basically you know so you know what subsidized you know the tense for people who can't afford to hire a lawyer but they're really nice bunch and I hope so they're being idealistic to in some way yeah they are although there are you know very down-to-earth when you talk to them about you know what it means to try and be a do-gooder and how quickly you learn
negative, you know one woman that I'm particularly friendly with of the public defender I like her a lot she is in the juvenile department and particularly frustrating cuz they're screwed up kids and the parents are screwed up too and you know she'll ask him know what their name and what happened and they'll say I didn't do it just tell me what happened to know it then Mom will say he didn't do it you know she's crying just just tell me what happened to you know the next time they have an appointment they don't show up so here's a public defender trying to say to the judge they're coming really really they are coming you know after days and days of preparing to defend this person that's questionable anyway so
negative, anyway it's soon as it's the truth though but you say you know everybody in town yeah yeah pretty much it's a very small town it's a little bit like those are for people say so I thought you were working at your front door where were you going this afternoon hey what you mean but for the most part it's pretty friendly people are people are fairly gossipy here which is not surprising but it's also pretty easy to to keep out of it somehow I don't know we don't find it too hard to just stay out of it. It turns me off a lot of people tell me stuff I wish I don't want to hear it you know I mean I just wish they didn't tell sometimes I tell people I don't want to hear it now just don't even tell me
negative, Adam the most part it's pretty friendly because I think also since you're stuck with each other here you are inspired and motivated to get along because for the most part everybody's going to stay here and there really is here to people differ about all kinds of things politics stuff and there's a level of friendliness that's very nice I mean I enjoyed being greeted by people and soon I find it it's took me a little getting used to go like I visited Berkeley this summer and everybody the minute they see you they look away like they're scared you know what you're going to do something to them
negative, goodness is not here I mean that loves people aren't afraid of each other in that way
negative, we can't afford to be suspicious can still see the person everyday right all right but also that fear of I don't know when when you're in a larger place I think it just naturally you have to cut out a lot too much stimulation I mean you just get over stimulated if he said if you said hide every single person you saw you walking in the streets of Jeannie that you'd be a wreck in an hour you know you know I mean actually I think people have their small cultures like in your business out that you know you have your small is this wonderful guy who I don't know where he lives. Somewhere but he always walks around here is crazy. Crazy and he's just referred to by everybody in the invidi knows of him they don't know him but they don't love him and it will calm the Cardinal the cardinal
negative, it in ending a lot of times it's totally incoherent to attack that he has but it's a real loud voice from Kelly's over the streets and it ain't just turned bladders on until you just hear me say I was in the Cardinals. He didn't write Cardinal that's pretty good we have a guy like that his name is Bible Bob and he just goes around blabbing about the Bible my meanin mostly really sometimes he stops and kicks occur but that's about it he's just going to take some he stops actually regularly in front of cross the street from our place a statue of Iron Man and he has pretty long conversations with Iron Man
negative, Shirley Wright that's pretty funny
negative, and how is Josh otherwise he's pretty good he's he's very good

negative, some advice for you is it my sister-in-law Joey she said if she would do it again she wouldn't have three she would have for a we are having for our we're going to matter of one my sanity will wait a few more months why did she say that because it doesn't work she said I know if you're going to have for well let's face it to look at Rachel is five and a half years younger than Carl and 7 and 1/2 younger than Sarah and it's just too much of a nice friend and I don't want her growing up being the only right so I probably will
negative, this is true but you know much but I know I know it goes to pregnancy again I don't want it all my gosh I do when I don't know I had a really easy was one if I had a good pregnancy with her and everything and it was wonderful but me and a man having a baby again and I'll just crawling around stuff I was out of that I really was you know I'm Into You know Mom I want to have my friends over right and I want to do this it's just really isn't just different ways I can imagine finding this is another one younger so on Friday I babysat for a they were one you know Rachel and then one years old in 2 years old my gosh but the one year-old and two-year-old get along real well so it wasn't too bad
negative, get some money coming in here for myself I'm going crazy yeah that's what helps with his babysitting so that I know of like a block-and-a-half away and I called up because one of the teachers there went to Kelvin oh yeah yeah and I used to sing with her over it one of the churches I was at but anyway so I called there anyway the principal called me back and he said they have an opening after the first of the year one day a week in the afternoon I said well I have kids of my own would have you promised no that's not a problem for after school care after school for 10 to 15 kids did you stay after school you know they play for a little bit and then come inside and do their homework and for 3 hours and then he says he knows sometimes people call out sick so the school I was thinking about for Jacob to go to
negative, so the private school it's a private Christian School well I don't know if I want him going there or not it's a very Fundamental School which is fine but I don't have a problem with but one of the philosophies or whatever it is about punishment and they have a statement in there saying that that we agree that it's okay for them for corporal punishment as long as there's one other adult you know what this thing is what the what you need to evaluate then is you know you know your child I mean like I don't believe that my children would ever do anything that would require them to be there may be a time
negative, if you don't know it and I just but the same time I do want my kids to learn discipline but I don't think they need to know so I have a hard time I would have a hard time with that but if you were there after school you kind of get an idea you know what's the way to get your foot in the door maybe by then their philosophy will change for something and I tell you that our school system because they changed the buses that used to be first grade to 8th grade all went on the same bus and now they split up now its first to 4th and 4th on 5th through 8th well so now the little kids start an hour later so they have free before-school care you can drop your child off at 7:00 in the morning cost a dollar for them to have cereal milk orange juice in a mini muffin and it's free to our town so I've been having we've been having to go to meetings for sale
negative, Marinette school at
negative, and it's 7:30 in the morning so a couple times I've taken the kids there
negative, I can't believe now they have after school care as well but if you have to pay for it but it's just a ton of people use it surprises me that is a problem I think with a private school you really have to look at their philosophies there's only like one teacher per grade so I mean it's a small school you know I would go I would take up you know that needs teachers and we've been fortunate we've I've been pretty happy with the public school here so
negative, Holly let me tell you they've been spayed you pick up some interesting things have you ever heard of that book Alexander the Horrible No Good Very Bad Day anyway there's a book out it's a cute bus and I was reading it to Carl one night and he goes mom will you visit me when I'm Sarah's age at school and I said yeah and he went to the whole neighborhood you know all the way up to 8th grade I'm taking you out like you're going to want me to visit you but yes I'll be there then he goes to be the first day of kindergarten when I first went I didn't know if I'd ever see you again in that was a very horrible day oh my God she's so cute book about how a kid has you know and he says I think I'll go to Australia is cute but but that's what Carl got out of that book oh my goodness you know you don't you don't know what kids are thinking and I didn't know that that was that stressful you know but you know but you don't know what goes through their heads
negative, about things but Sarah would never tell me. He's at school and everything and we've had her at a neurologist in and all that and she's really doing he's doing so much better and this summer she went for a occupational therapy of called sensory integration I don't know if you know about that I learned a lot about that this summer and this kid my child likes to dance and stand she's she's a she's also been the neurologist says she's attention deficit but not the attention deficit where she runs around that that is not socially acceptable but she hasn't stopped running around inside her head
negative, and so so anyways dispensaries Grayson has been I can't tell you how much I've learned about her it would be you don't like the OT would say to me your daughter is a type of child that does this and I would say I remember when she did that when she was 2 years old and you know it really it's like me and I wasn't such a bad parent it was because of snow and she's just neurologist have been really good and sent you know she's upstairs going to be fine when she goes up but we need to make it as easy as possible for her teacher was saying how well Sarah plans at school and she organizes itself and that's part of her goals is organization and planning and everything and I said but you taste the plan and she will not get it at first it will take her long time and then they're all just said trust that's because Sarah is smart enough to know that she has to organize herself in order to survive and
negative, because she's doing real well but I just learned a lot about her and I just had Carl evaluated by the neurologist cuz she said she would let us know and she said he has none of the motor problems that she has so it was just you know it's been nice this woman has really been on target is for us we've I've learned a lot and cross our insurance won't let us go for OT anymore but she gets it at school but it's not as nice as the one that we've received a Massachusetts so come this summer guessing we're going to do it again so we have this bungee swing in our in our basement and I'm sure I'm sure Jacob would just love it it spins and it bounces up and down and you can swing and it's it's really it's like a cute for an older child it's like a jumper right and the kids loved it since they play down in my dad helped me bolt it to Arbor the ceiling of her basement
negative, he figured out how to put a swivel because they use discount climbing equipment to hang things at this OT place right but my dad figure out a way and it cost us like $0.50 and it does just what it does at the place down in Massachusetts where we would go so I'm a big believer now and sensory integration I didn't know very much about it and I've learned quite a bit so but now I'm done believing that children really need to do you know I and now I can see where you know when I kids that I take care of her whatever I just said sensory integration
negative, being in the field of MR2 you know you know you look at all these kids in the store or whatever you got that person is registered here there you know
negative, therapy or are you know exactly my next door neighbor she's dealing with a kid he's got sensory integration up and down then her daughter she has fits everyone and getting dressed cuz she doesn't like the putting on the closet act that she doesn't like that she doesn't like snow pants cuz they let you know this and that and you cannot touch that kid lately cuz she's ready to punch you out but you know and it's like this is so clear to me yeah I wish time would take some developmental classes it would help so much with Jacob in yesterday we went he wanted to go play tennis we driving down there and there was nobody to play tennis well that was bad so I said why don't you come with us we're going to go to factory outlet to buy Christmas decorations
